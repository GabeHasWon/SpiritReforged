v0.1.2.5
- Fixed a conflict between Spirit and Remnants leading to crashes during the Scarecrow microstructure generation step
- Improved Cartography Table multiplayer loading and syncing (thanks to tomat!)
- Fixed a tooltip error in the Rogue's Crest
- Fixed issues with the Campfire Spit occasionally causing crashes
- Fixed a desync issue with Hydrothermal Vents in multiplayer
- Added text to Scarecrow discovery step
- TEMPORARY: The "Enchanted Swords" step from Remnants will NOT run when Reforged is active
	This is to stop a common softlock, and was recommended by wombat (Remnant's dev)
	This will only apply to Remnants v2.0.9 and will not apply to newer versions
