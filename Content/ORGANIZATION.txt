# Hi. This is how the mod will be organized internally.
# I chose this organization because it groups similar content very close together very consistently, even if it's not the same type of entity or object.
# It also allows us to fully ignore old namespaces and content when creating new content, generating less mess and a nicer codebase.

Content/ # This is for all CONTENT: In short, all entities or ModTypes. This includes non-mechanic ModPlayers, ModSystems and the like.
	Major Content Piece/ # This is one piece of cohesive content. For example, Ocean, Starjinx, Bismite would all be cohesive content pieces.
		NPCs/
			...
		Tiles/
			...
		MainSystem.cs # This should only be done when there is ONE major ModSystem, ModPlayer, or so on of one type for the given content piece.
	2nd Major Content Piece
		Items/
		NPCs/
	...
		...
Common/ # This is for systems and mechanics. Each sub-folder should be split into the content it functions alongside the most.
	TileCommon/ 
		...

Assets/ # Assets, such as sound, texture and shaders.
	SFX/
	Music/
	Textures/
	Effects/

# Additionally, there's some rules on how many classes can be per file.
# All files must contain one cohesive piece of content - much like the folder structure.
# However, since a lot of content is boilerplate, you MAY include multiple classes in one file. 
# The main class is whatever you want it to be, a large enough piece of content. 
# All subclasses MUST be entirely or mostly boilerplate or superfluous, such as this:

public class SomeTile : ModTile
{
	// Content here, not included for brevity
	
	public class SomeTileItem : ModItem
	{
		public override SetDefaults() => Item.DefaultToPlaceableTile(ModContent.TileType<SomeTile>());
	}
}

# PLEASE keep multiple classes in check, If you have 2+ subclasses in one file, consider splitting it up.
# I want to avoid constantly needing to reference other namespaces for what are generally extremely short files, especially in the case of items -
# but this gets out of hand pretty quickly. Use your own discretion!
