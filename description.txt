[c/ffc163:Spirit Reforged] is a general content mod which aims to create a fleshed out, high-quality experience for players at all points of progression. We want to make your world come to life by creating memorable environments, encounters, and high-quality items. 

Spirit Reforged is the latest and main project developed by Team Spirit, also responsible for the original Spirit Mod (now called [c/cffffd:Spirit Classic]). 

Spirit Reforged is a [c/ffc163:standalone] project and does not have to be played with Spirit Classic. However, Reforged has extra cross-compatibility with Spirit Classic. You can explore Spirit Reforged while sticking with the vast amount of content Spirit Classic provides. 

Our brand new update, Caves and Clubs (v0.1.1) brings you a new subclass: clubs, new underground worldgen, new enemies, weapons, NPCs, and more! Here are the stats at a glance:

- 312 Items
- 1 New Minibiome: The Savanna
- 33 Enemies and NPCs, including 2 new wandering World NPCs to encounter
- Numerous microbiomes, microstructures, and discoveries scattered across the world

We hope you enjoy Spirit Reforged and join Team Spirit on our next adventure.
