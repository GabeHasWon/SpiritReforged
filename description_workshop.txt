Spirit Reforged is a general content mod which aims to create a fleshed out, high-quality experience for players at all points of progression. We want to make your world come to life by creating memorable environments, encounters, and high-quality items. 

Spirit Reforged is the latest and main project developed by Team Spirit, also responsible for the original Spirit Mod (now called Spirit Classic). 

Spirit Reforged is a standalone project and does not have to be played with Spirit Classic. However, Reforged has extra cross-compatibility with Spirit Classic. You can explore Spirit Reforged while sticking with the vast amount of content Spirit Classic provides. 

Version 0.1 brings you a new ecotone minibiome, the Savanna, as well as an Ocean expansion, new weapons, NPCs, and more. Here are the stats at a glance:

- 229 Items
- 1 New Minibiome: The Savanna
- 28 Enemies and NPCs, including 2 new wandering World NPCs to encounter
- Numerous microbiomes, microstructures, and discoveries scattered across the world

We hope you enjoy Spirit Reforged and join Team Spirit on our next adventure.
